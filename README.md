# 💻 Tabletizer Desktop

This is the **desktop companion app** for the **Tabletizer** project — a system designed to repurpose old tablets or phones as **wireless drawing tablets** for PCs or laptops via socket connections.

---

## 🧠 Overview

**Tabletizer Desktop** handles the **receiver side** of the communication.
It listens for input events (touch, stylus, gestures) sent from the **Tabletizer Mobile** app and maps them to system-level pointer movements, making your old device act as a pen tablet.
